# ClassroomAverage






<h3 align="center">Classroom Average Database Management System</h3>
The purpose of this assignment is to build a basic web application for managing student grades. I used JavaScript to create, display, and update student data within an HTML table. Additionally, the application calculates and displays the classroom's average grade.
